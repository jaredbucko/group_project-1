# Pass the Remote
Do you ever feel overwhelmed by the amount of entertainment content in the world today? Do you argue with friends and loved ones about what to watch? Do you just need someone to decide for you? Pass the Remote is a fun and easy-to-use web app that gives you a semi-randomized recommendation based on your responses to a short series of questions meant to narrow down the list of possible suggestions. Powered by The Movie Database (TMDb) API, Pass the Remote is a group project created by Chase Anderson, Jared Bucko, and Kyle Sandoval for the University of Oregon Web Development Bootcamp.
